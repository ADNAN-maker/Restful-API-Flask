        "Securing a Flask API involves implementing various measures across different layers of your application.\n",
        "1. Authentication and Authorization:\n",
        "\n",
        "Token-based Authentication (e.g., JWT):\n",
        "This is a common and recommended approach for APIs. Users log in, receive a signed JSON Web Token (JWT), and include this token in subsequent requests for authentication. Libraries like Flask-JWT-Extended or PyJWT can facilitate this.\n",
        "\n",
        "OAuth 2.0:\n",
        "For more complex scenarios involving third-party applications or delegated access, integrate OAuth 2.0.\n",
        "Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):\n",
        "Define roles (e.g., admin, user) and assign specific permissions to each role. Implement authorization checks at the endpoint level to ensure users only access resources they are permitted to. Libraries like Flask-Security-Too can help with user management and role-based access.\n",
        "2. Data Security:\n",
        "HTTPS/TLS:\n",
        "Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n",
        "Secure Password Storage:\n",
        "Never store plain-text passwords. Use strong, one-way cryptographic hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) with a salt for password storage.\n",
        "Data Encryption at Rest:\n",
        "If sensitive data is stored in a database or file system, consider encrypting it at rest.\n",
        "3. Input Validation and Sanitization:\n",
        "Prevent Injection Attacks:\n",
        "Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and other injection vulnerabilities. Use ORMs or parameterized queries for database interactions.\n",
        "Input Length and Type Checks:\n",
        "Ensure inputs conform to expected types and lengths to prevent buffer overflows or unexpected behavior.\n",
        "4. Session Management (if applicable):\n",
        "Secure Session Cookies: If using Flask sessions, ensure cookies are secure (e.g., HttpOnly, Secure flags) and the SECRET_KEY is strong and kept confidential, preferably loaded from environment variables.\n",
        "5. Rate Limiting and Throttling:\n",
        "Prevent Brute-Force Attacks and Abuse: Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests a user or IP address can make within a given time frame. Libraries like Flask-Limiter can assist."

It acts like a dictionary where you can store and retrieve data associated with a particular user's session.
